Analyses were performed using R statistical software , version 3.0 .
The stimuli were programmed on a Mac Pro computer ( Mac Pro 3.1 , Quad - Core Intel Xeon 2.8 GHz ) using Matlab Version R 2009b and Psychtoolbox [57] , [58] , and displayed using a Mitsubishi Electric colour data projector ( Model XD 400U ) back - projected onto large ( 1.48 m wide by 1.20 m high ) screen mounted on the lab wall .
Results were then fitted with cumulative Gaussian psychometric functions using custom Matlab code , to give a value for each subject ' s point of subjective equality ( PSE ) for the speed of smooth radial flow that matched the perceived speed of the oscillating flow .
The mothur pipeline [40] was used for denoising , trimming , alignment to the Silva reference alignment and removal of chimerae .
All the analyses were performed using the “ survival ” package [27] from R [28] .
Custom Basic code was written to control the microscope .
Such a procedure combines the experimenter ' s prior knowledge ( tGuess = − 1 , tGuessSd = 5.0 , beta = 3.5 , delta = 0.01 , gamma = 0.5 in QUEST software of Psychophysics Toolbox [36] ) and the observer ' s responses ( i.e. , right or left ) in past trials in choosing the signal strength for the next trial , and , in the end , estimating threshold .
The resulting sequences were analyzed using Mothur v. 1.33.3 [12] .
The shared OTUs ( 97 % sequence identity ) between life stages ( eggs , L2 larvae and workers ) were determined using the Venn diagram package implemented in Mothur .
The Venny 2.0.2 software was used to plot resulting data .
The redundant sequences were removed and the sequences were aligned using SILVA SINA ( www.arb-silva.de/aligner/ ) with the reference dataset SILVA SSU Ref NR [17] .

Specific primers for CXCL 1 were designed using Oligo Calc ( Kibbe , 2007 ) as follow : 5 ’ - CACTGCACCCAAACCGAAGTCATA - 3 ’ ; 5 ’ - TCTCCGTTACTTGGGGACACCTTT - 3 ’ ; A DNA Master Plus SYBR Green Kit ( Roche Diagnostics , France ) was used in a LightCycler 2.0 ( Roche Diagnostics , France ) with an initial incubation of 10 min at 95 ° C , 40 amplification cycles of ten seconds at 95 ° C , of 8 sec at 60 ° C , and of 10 sec at 72 ° C , during which the fluorescence data were collected .
Representation and data analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism 5 software .
We used the SAS package ( version 9.1 ) for statistical analysis in this study .
fMRI movie data were preprocessed using AFNI software [42] ( http://afni.nimh.nih.gov ) .
Any spikes in the data were removed using 3dDespike in AFNI .
Data were then filtered using 3dBandpass in AFNI to remove any temporal signal variation slower than 0.00667 Hz , faster than 0.1 Hz or that correlated with the whole brain average signal or the head movement parameters .
Each subject ’ s anatomical volume was first aligned to the motion corrected average EPI volume and then to the MNI 152 brain template in AFNI .
Definition of masks and searchlights for movie data : We derived a gray matter mask by segmenting the MNI _ avg 152T 1 brain provided in AFNI and removing any voxel that was outside the cortical surface by more than twice the thickness of the gray matter at each surface node .
Cortical nodes were defined in a standard cortical surface from FreeSurfer ( fsaverage ) ( https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu ) and resampled into a regular grid using AFNI ’ s MapIcosahedron [42,43] with 10,242 nodes in each hemisphere .
We defined the surface searchlights [44] in PyMVPA [45] ( http://www.pymvpa.org ) as cortical disks .
The thickness of disks was extended beyond the gray matter , as defined in FreeSurfer , 1.5 times inside the white - matter gray - matter boundary and 1.0 times outside the gray - matter pial surface boundary to accommodate any misalignment of gray matter as computed from the anatomical scan and the gray matter voxels in the EPI scan .
Searchlights for defining connectivity targets were defined using a coarse surface grid corresponding to the ico 8 surface in SUMA [43] with 1284 nodes ( 10.7 mm spacing between nodes ) .
For each subject , we used their cortical surfaces and fMRI data aligned to the group using MSM - All [22] with 32K nodes in each hemisphere as provided by the HCP .
We defined connectivity target searchlights using a coarser surface grid corresponding to the ico 8 surface in SUMA [43] with 1284 nodes ( 10.7 mm spacing between nodes ) .
These searchlights are aligned across subjects based on anatomy ( movie data ) or MSM - All ( HCP resting state data ) ; consequently , each locus within a searchlight is similarly aligned across subjects before CHA .
Local transformation matrices for each searchlight map anatomically or MSM - All aligned cortical loci in a cortical field to CHA - aligned dimensions in the common model connectome .
We searched for terms and cortical areas implicated in visual , auditory , cognitive , and social functions in NeuroSynth [22] and took the coordinates for the peak location associated with each of 24 terms ( S1 Table ) .
We used bootstrapping to test for significance of the contrasts between alignment methods by sampling subjects 10,000 times to compute 95 % CIs using BootES [51] .
Control for effect of filtering : In addition to the anatomically - aligned movie data and MSM - All aligned HCP resting state fMRI data , we calculated a third dataset that controls for the effect of filtering the data through CHA transformations but aligns those filtered data across subjects based on anatomical or MSM - All alignment .
ISCs were calculated for data mapped into the common model connectome , for movie data aligned anatomically , for HCP resting state data aligned with MSM - All , and for filter control movie and HCP data .
To account for the effect of filtering , we did this analyses with filter control data that were filtered with CHA but aligned based on anatomy and MSM - All and after CHA with each subject aligned to the same reference subject [16] .
We implemented our methods and ran our analyses in PyMVPA [45] ( http://www.pymvpa.org ) unless otherwise specified .
All preprocessing and analyses were carried out on a 64 - bit Debian 7.0 ( wheezy ) system with additional software from NeuroDebian [52] ( http://neuro.debian.net ) .
All analyses were performed using SAS v. 9.4 ( SAS Institute Inc . Cary , NC , USA ) and a level of 0.05 was used for statistical significance .
When geo - referenced localities were not available ( only locality names ) , geographic coordinates were obtained with the software Google Earth .
The precise location of all surveyed occurrence were checked using the software Google Earth and only localities within the known distribution range of the species were used for analysis [11] .
This procedure was performed using SDMtoolbox [16] , resulting in a total of 44 unique occurrence records .
ENMs were developed using a maximum entropy algorithm implemented in the software MaxEnt version 3.3.3k [23] .
MaxEnt is a general - purpose machine learning software that uses presence - only data [23] .
It has been widely used to predict species distribution , including tephritid species [4,22] and in addition to its robust statistical properties , MaxEnt shows a high performance across several niche modelling methods for presence - only data [24] .
Following this approach , occurrence data was partitioned in four groups based on spatial clustering of occurrence points [16] , rather than split the data randomly in groups of equal sample size , as the k - fold cross - validation implemented in MaxEnt .
This procedure was performed using SDMtoolbox [16] .
First , two sets of variables were selected and then the Pearson ’ s correlation test performed with the software ENMtools v 1.3 [31] was used to ensure the lack of multicolinearity among the selected predictors [32] .
MaxEnt and most correlative ENMs generate pseudo - absence sample points randomly selected from the background study area [33] .
MaxEnt allows users to select a variety of “ feature classes ” that can be used to build very complex and highly nonlinear response curves [26] .
A feature is a function of an environmental variable , and in MaxEnt it can be a combination of six classes : linear ( L ) , quadratic ( Q ) , product ( P ) , hinge ( H ) and threshold ( T ) .
While users can specify the feature to be used , MaxEnt automatically selects individual features for each predictor that contribute most to model fit using regularization coefficient β [23,26] .
Studies have demonstrated that less complex and transferable models can be built by tuning the regularization multiplier to values higher than the default of MaxEnt [ 26 , 27 , 38 ] .
Therefore , in addition to MaxEnt default , regularization multiplier values of 3 and 5 were also tested in the development of the models .
Additionally , BIC was calculated with the software ENMtools v 1.3 [31] using the full data set .
To assess climate novelty in the transferred regions , a Multivariate Environmental Similarity Surface test ( MESS ) implemented in MaxEnt was performed .
Additionally , we restricted model projections to climate conditions encountered during training by disabling extrapolate options in MaxEnt .
A large number of respondents were eliminated by algorithms in the Globalpark software as the data collection process proceeded , using the following criteria : those whose answers were abnormally patterned ( e.g. , used the same response for a majority of questions , or answered the questionnaire too quickly , based on the average speed of questionnaire completion ) those missing a single response , either demographic or in the main questionnairethose screened out by not fitting into demographic quotas ( i.e. , respondents have to fulfil the demographic criteria to determine eligibility , and even if eligible , whether the quota for their profile is already full , before they can complete the questionnaire proper ) .
All such interviews were conducted by native language interviewers in each country using CATI - SPSS Dimensions software .
Online responses were exported from an integrated research platform ( Globalpark ) by Opinion Matters personnel into a survey reporting software program ( SNAP ) , and from thence were converted into an Excel spreadsheet .
Interviewers recorded telephone and face - to - face responses by hand onto printed data - sheets which were then transcribed into electronic records in an Excel database using codes consistent with the on - line records .
To evaluate risk factors affecting diagnosing PBM by MRCP , a stepwise logistic regression analysis was performed with SAS 8 . 0 .
Data were preprocessed and analyzed using SPM 8 software ( Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience , www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm ) implemented in MATLAB ( Mathworks , Natick , MA ) .
EPI time series were corrected for motion and distortion using “ Realign and Unwarp ” [31] using the generated field map together with the Fieldmap toolbox [32] provided in SPM 8 .
The swimming path of the mice was recorded by a video camera and analyzed by the Videomot 2 software ( TSE ) .
Immunoblots were quantified using ImageJ ( NIH ) .
Statistical analysis was performed using Prism software .
Data were acquired using HEKA EPC 10 and analyzed by Patchmaster ( HEKA ) .
Protein identification , quantification , and phosphosite determination : All MS data was interpreted using the using the Spectrum Mill software package v 4.0 beta ( Agilent Technologies , Santa Clara , CA ) .
Peptides were considered not quantifiable if they were shared across multiple subgroups of a protein or the precursor ions had a poorly defined isotope cluster ( i.e. the “ subgroup specific ” and “ exclude poor isotope quality precursor ” XIC filters in Spectrum Mill were enabled ) .
The peak area for the XIC of each precursor ion subjected to MS / MS was calculated automatically by the Spectrum Mill software in the intervening high - resolution MS 1 scans of the LC - MS / MS runs using narrow windows around each individual member of the isotope cluster .
The STATA v 11.2 software was used to perform statistical analysis .
The computer system ( acer Veriton M2610 , processor : Intel Core i3 - 2120 3.3G / 3M / 65W , memory : 4GB DDR 3 - 1066 , operating system : Microsoft Windows 7 Professional 64bit ) used by the subject was put under a desk ( 0.70 x 1.26 m , height 0.73 m ) .
